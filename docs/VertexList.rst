VertexList==========The VertexList object is a indexed set of vectorial vertices, and is often used in conjection with either SparseGraph, SparseMultiGraph or DenseGraph. The following example demonstrates its usage: :: 	from apgl.graph import * 	import numpy 	numVertices = 10 	numFeatures = 3	vList = VertexList(numVertices, numFeatures)	value = numpy.array([0.1, 0.5, 0.1])	vList.setVertex(0, value)This code creates a VertexList object, and assigns a value to the first vertex. Methods -------.. autoclass:: apgl.graph.VertexList.VertexList   :members:    :inherited-members:   :undoc-members:   :show-inheritance:
